A project that uses Javascript with a gulp file to make a Web Site to determine a user’s age based on a planet’s solar years.

An application where users can have their ages taken down to seconds and have different ages calculated for different planets as not all plans have 365 days in a solar year such as Mercury where a solar year is 88 days. Date of README: 10/13/2017

Description

There are the following features in the Project: Returns age of a person on Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and determines user life expectancy. There are custom classes and custom functions(plain).

To Test Locally

git clone https://github.com/bigplans47/super_galactic_age_calculator.git to your desktop cd super_galactic_age_calculator macbook to install all required packages run $npm install $bower install $gulp build $gulp serve and use the site that pops up. Then to see specs are passing run $npm test

Specifications

Write an application that determines a user’s age based on a planet’s solar years:

Take a person’s age in years and convert it into seconds.
Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two. (This way a user can enter a birthdate and the application can compare the birthdate against the current time to come up with an accurate age.)
Return the age of a human in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
Return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
Return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user’s life expectancy. (Note that life expectancy shouldn’’t be a hard-coded value. After all, it can vary from country to country and depending on various demographics.)
If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, your application should account for (and test) this possible outcome as well.
